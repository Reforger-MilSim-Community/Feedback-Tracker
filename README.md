# RMC Feedback Tracker
The official feedback tracker for Reforger MilSim Community's Arma Reforger server and other services.

## How do I make a bug report?
> We understand that having a buggy experience is annonying, this is why we have a great system like this to help us get rid of them!
> **Firstly**, click the **Issues** tab at the top of this page.
> **Secondly**, press **New issue** and select the type of issue you are making.
> **Lastly**, follow the steps within the template and submit your issue!
> *__TIP__: The more details, the better, put your logs in, screenshots, videos and any other details such as where you were and what you were doing - this greatly helps when we are tracking down bugs!*

## How do I make a feature request?
> Got an exciting mod in mind? Maybe a small tinker to our current system? Or some new items? Then make a feature request so we know what the community wants!
> **Firstly**, click the **Issues** tab at the top of this page.
> **Secondly**, press **New issue** and select the type of issue you are making.
> **Lastly**, follow the steps within the template and submit your issue!
> *__TIP__: Same as the bug report, the more details you give us, the more we can get the feature implemented as close to the request as possible! Links, media and even drawings are great!*
